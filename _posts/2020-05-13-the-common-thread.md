Software systems development is one of the most collaborative, creative things that humans do. We can make software do whatever we want as long as the thing we're doing it to can be represented as digital data: streams of bits in files, records from a database, or streaming information from a camera or a sensor or a satellite.

Across generations, no matter what software development technologies and what's considered the new hotness or old and busted, the process we follow to produce those software systems is remarkably the same. We learn about that process in our college software-engineering classes (like mine back in the 1800's). We experience that process when we're delivering solutions for our employers or clients. And we suffer equally when we get mad and try to short-change the process.

There is a common sequence of activity that happens to produce software systems -- the common thread.
